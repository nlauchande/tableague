# Feature set

* Stateless mode - Done
Means that the league of the state is kept in a file and calculations do happen in memory

* Keep State - TODO
Means that the league of the state is kept in a local database
Multiple files for games can be provided as long as the db still exists


#Assumptions

* We could have a very huge league up to 100k game results file

* The games per se are not important the most important thing is the scoring mechanism


#Testing production oriented datasets - TODO

* A dataset was generated with specialized tools. Results of the games were calculated independently 
with an excel spreadsheet to have an independent approach to calculate points.
